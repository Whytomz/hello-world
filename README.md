# hello-world

Hi Everyone

I'm new to coding. Currently going to college chasing for a vbachelor degree for software development. 
I'm more proficient web development (html, CSS, Javascrip), but also average in SQL and Java coding. 

I would like to build my skills as a programmer so i can help make the world a better place.
