# hello-world

Hi Everyone

I go by the name of Whytomz and I'm very new new to coding. Currently attending to college chasing for a vbachelor degree for software development. 
I'm more proficient web development (html, CSS, Javascrip), but also average in SQL and Java coding. 

I would like to build my skills as a programmer so I can help make the world a better place.
